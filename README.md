# SecondUnityPrototype

## What is this?

This is the second project from the second unit of the Junior Programmer Pathway from ```learn.unity.com```. In this unit, we had to make a game where we control a farmer that throws food at animals. There was also a challenge in which we had to make a game in which we need to catch balls with dogs.

## Gameplay

### Prototype 2

This is the game where we have to throw food at animals. The user can move up, down, left and right. Animals come from up, left, right, and the user can shoot food only forward. The scope of the game is to shoot animals to feed them, and for each animal feed, you receive 1 point. Animals require to be feed multiple times to be satisfied. However, if you collide with an animal, you loose one of your 3 lives, and when all lives are lost it's game over. Although, the game doesn't have programmed any game over state, and the score and lives can only be seen in the debug console, inaccessible in the built game.

### Challenge 2

In this game, you have to shoot dogs in a straight line to catch the balls that fall from the top of the screen. If a ball is not caught, it's game over, although, as well as with the other game, this state is not programmed and the game doesn't stop.

## Controls

### Prototype 2

This game is controlled using either WASD or the arrow keys and the food is shoot with the space key.

### Challenge 2

In this game, only one button is used, space, which shoots the dogs.

## Building the game.

The game can be built by simply downloading the source code, opening it in Unity Hub, and using unity's utility to built the game for the desired platforms. Selecting which game is built is done by selecting which scene to built.
